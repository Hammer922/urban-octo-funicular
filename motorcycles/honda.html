        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>The Honda CBR1000RR, marketed in some countries as the "Fireblade" (capitalized as FireBlade until the
          2000s[2]), is a 999 cc (61.0 cu in) liquid-cooled inline four-cylinder superbike, introduced by Honda in 2003
          as the 7th generation of the CBR series of motorcycles that began with the CBR900RR in 1990.</p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>The Honda CBR1000RR was developed by the same team that was behind the MotoGP series.[3] Many of the new
          technologies introduced in the Honda CBR600RR, a direct descendant of the RC211V, were used in the new
          CBR1000RR such as a lengthy swingarm, Unit Pro-Link rear suspension, and Dual Stage Fuel Injection System
          (DSFI).</p>
        <p>The seventh-generation RR (SC57), the Honda CBR1000RR, was the successor to the 2002 CBR954RR. While evolving
          the CBR954RR design, few parts were carried over to the CBR1000RR.[4] The compact 998 cc (60.9 cu in) in-line
          four was a new design, with different bore and stroke dimensions, race-inspired cassette-type six-speed
          gearbox, all-new ECU-controlled ram-air system, dual-stage fuel injection, and center-up exhaust with a new
          computer-controlled butterfly valve. The chassis was likewise all-new, including an organic-style aluminum
          frame composed of Gravity Die-Cast main sections and Fine Die-Cast steering head structure, inverted fork,
          Unit Pro-Link rear suspension, radial-mounted front brakes, and a centrally located fuel tank hidden under a
          faux cover. Additionally, the Honda Electronic Steering Damper (HESD) debuted as an industry first system
          which aimed to improve stability and help eliminate head shake while automatically adjusting for high and low
          speed steering effort.</p>
        <p>A longer swingarm acted as a longer lever arm in the rear suspension for superior traction under acceleration
          and more progressive suspension action. Longer than the corresponding unit on the CBR954RR (585 mm (23.0 in)
          compared to 551 mm (21.7 in)) the CBR1000RR's 34 mm (1.3 in) longer swingarm made up 41.6 percent of its total
          wheelbase. The CBR1000RR's wheelbase also increased, measuring 1,405 mm (55.3 in); a 5 mm (0.20 in) increase
          over the 954.</p>
        <p>Accommodating the longer swingarm was another reason the CBR1000RR power plant shared nothing with the 954.
          Shortening the engine compared to the 954 meant rejecting the conventional in-line layout. Instead, engineers
          positioned the CBR1000RR's crankshaft, main shaft and countershaft in a triangulated configuration, with the
          countershaft located below the main shaft, dramatically shortening the engine front to back, and moving the
          swingarm pivot closer to the crankshaft. This configuration was first successfully introduced by Yamaha with
          the YZF-R1 model in 1998 and inspired superbike design in the following years.</p>
        <p>Positioning this compact engine farther forward in the chassis also increased front-end weight bias, an
          effective method of making high-powered liter bikes less wheelie prone under hard acceleration. This approach,
          however, also provided very little space between the engine and front wheel for a large radiator. Engineers
          solved this problem by giving the RR a modest cylinder incline of 28Â°, and moving the oil filter from its
          frontal placement on the 954 to the right side of the 1000RR engine. This allowed the RR's center-up exhaust
          system to tuck closely to the engine.</p>
        <p>The eighth generation RR (SC57) was introduced in 2006 and offered incremental advancements over the earlier
          model, and less weight. Changes for 2006 included:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>New intake and exhaust porting (higher flow, reduced chamber volume)</li>
          <li>Higher compression ratio (from 11.9:1 to 12.3:1)</li>
          <li>Revised cam timing</li>
          <li>More intake valve lift (from 8.9 mm to 9.1 mm)</li>
          <li>Double springs for the intake valves</li>
          <li>Higher redline (from 11,250rpm to 12,200rpm)</li>
          <li>Larger rear sprocket (from 41 to 42 teeth)</li>
          <li>New exhaust system</li>
          <li>New chassis geometry</li>
          <li>Larger 320 mm (13 in) front brake discs but thinner at 4.5 mm (0.18 in)</li>
          <li>Larger 220 mm (8.7 in) rear brake discs but thinner at 4.5 mm (0.18 in)</li>
          <li>Revised rear suspension with new linkage ratios 135 mm</li>
          <li>New lighter swingarm</li>
          <li>Smaller, lighter rear caliper</li>
          <li>Revised front fairing design</strong></li>
        </ul>
